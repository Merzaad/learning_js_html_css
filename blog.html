                <p>
                    The NTA said that crypto investors need to make a note of coins' market prices at the time of
                    acquisition - or they may face problems when making tax declarations.

                <h2>Gold Price Forecast</h2>
                <p>
                    Gold rose for the second week in a row and finished slightly below
                    $1810 after rebounding from $1783. It was unable to hit fresh monthly highs.
                    The yellow metal continued to improve its outlook, with a close above
                    the 55-week simple moving average. The upside continues to face resistance around $1810/15.  A break of that area should clear the way for a test of the next critical level seen at the $1830 region.
                    The immediate short-term support could be seen at $1793 followed by
                    the 20-day simple moving average at $1784. A daily close under $1780
                    could anticipate more losses and a potential slide to $1750.
